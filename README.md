# EspoCRM Email Preview Extension (Enhanced)

This is an enhanced fork of the [Email Preview Extension by mozkomor05](https://github.com/mozkomor05/espocrm-email-preview-extension).

This version builds upon the original by adding new features to improve email management and visibility within EspoCRM.

## Features

This extension includes all the features of the original, plus:

*   **Assigned Users in List View**: See which users are assigned to an email directly in the combined email list view.
*   **Drag-and-Drop to Folders**: Easily organize your emails by dragging them from the list and dropping them into your desired folder.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest release package (`.zip` file) from the Releases page of this repository.
2.  Log in to your EspoCRM instance as an administrator.
3.  Navigate to `Administration` > `Extensions`.
4.  Upload the downloaded `.zip` file and click "Install".

## Credits
